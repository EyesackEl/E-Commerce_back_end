## Description
This project is a mock back end for an e-commerce platform to keep track of inventory and its associated data. This is done using object-relational-mapping on the databases the information is stored on.

## Installation
To install create a .env file with DB_USER, DB_PW, and DB_NAME variables, DB_NAME should be 'ecommerce_db'. Use npm i to install dependencies and run npm run seed to seed the database. From there the server can be run  locally and all routes will work as intended.
